# Ritmo restaurant order app

This is a food order app and an inventory management system for a fictive restaurant called the Ritmo restaurant. It's made in Next.js, combining a React.js frontend with a Node.js backend. This project is made for my bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology at the University of Twente.

## Database key disclaimer

We are aware that in the .env file (environment variables), the private database keys are visible. We INTENTIONALLY excluded the .env file from our .gitignore so that this app can be easily tested in a local environment without further configuration. In the end, this is not a mission critical app but just a uni project.
